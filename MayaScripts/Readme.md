This folder contains Maya script snippets to generate and parse our mesh files around.

Some planned features include

1. Based on simple curve definition in uv space, generate mesh with crease(mountain/valley) information
2.  Based on .cp files from Jun Mitani, generate .obj files that can be read by primomeshviewer
3.  Based on .obj files generated by primo mesh viewer, generate blendshapes in maya
